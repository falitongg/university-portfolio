## Task 00 – Formatted Stream Output

A simple function, `write_stats`, is to be implemented. This function accepts a dataset and an output stream, into which three statistical values are to be written: minimum, maximum, and mean.

Data must be recorded in a specific format. For the input `1.23, 5.44, -23`, the output is required to appear as follows:

```text
min: -23.00
max: 5.44
mean: -5.44
