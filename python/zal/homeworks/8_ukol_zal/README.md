# Task 8 - Binary Search Tree

The goal of this task is to implement a data structure called a binary search tree. Unlike a (linear) linked list, in this structure each node can have up to two successors: a left node and a right node (see the figure on the right). The rule for creating new nodes is that the value of the left successor is always smaller than the value of the current node, and conversely, the value of the right successor is always greater than the value in the current node. If a given node has no successor(s), then the left/right/both references point to None.

Our binary search tree will be able to perform the following operations: insert new nodes individually (insert() method) or from an array (fromArray() method), check whether a given element is in the tree (search() method returning True/False), find the minimum and maximum values in the tree (min() and max() methods). In the case of an empty tree, the min() and max() methods return None. Finally, there will be a visitedNodes() method, which returns the number of nodes visited during the last call of one of the methods: search(), min(), or max(). This value also corresponds to the depth at which the searched node is located, if it occurs in the tree (the first node has a depth of one). The tree contains only unique values (i.e., each value is represented at most once).
