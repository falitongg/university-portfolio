## 1. Introduction

This project implements a console-based Maze Game in C++. The player moves through a procedurally generated maze with the goal of finding the exit. The maze is generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm.

### 1.1 Goal of the Game

The player controls a character (`@`) placed at the starting position (top-left corner) and attempts to navigate the maze to reach the exit marked by the symbol `E`. The game ends upon reaching the exit.

### 1.2 Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++20
* **Libraries:**
* `<iostream>` - for input and output
* `<vector>` - for managing the 2D game grid
* `<utility>` - for working with pairs (coordinates)
* `<random>`, `<algorithm>` - for generating random mazes
* `<string>` - for working with text strings


* **Build System:** CMake 3.10+
* **Compiler:** g++ with C++20 support

## 3. Solution Architecture

### 3.1 Object-Oriented Model

The program uses an **object-oriented design** with five main classes:

```
        Game (main controller)
          |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |     |     |     |     |
  Maze  Gen.  Play. Rend. Helper

```

#### 3.1.1 Game Class

**Responsibility:** High-level game controller

**Main Components:**

```cpp
class Game {
private:
    Maze maze;           // Maze instance
    Generator generator; // Maze generator
    Player player;       // Player
    Renderer renderer;   // Rendering
    bool isRunning;      // Game state

```

**Main Methods:**

* `initialize()` - initializes the game:
* Displays the size selection menu
* Creates a maze of the chosen size
* Generates the maze using `Generator`
* Places the exit and the player


* `run()` - main game loop:
```
while (isRunning) {
    render();      // Draw current state
    handleInput(); // Read and process input
    update();      // Update game state
}

```


* `handleInput()` - processes user input (W/A/S/D/Q/H)
* `update()` - checks the win condition
* `render()` - delegates drawing to Renderer

#### 3.1.2 Maze Class

**Responsibility:** Representation of the maze structure

**Data Structures:**

```cpp
class Maze {
private:
    std::pair<int, int> size;              // Width and height
    std::vector<std::vector<char>> maze;   // 2D grid
    std::pair<int, int> exitCoordinates;   // Exit position

```

**Main Methods:**

* `getCell(x, y)` - returns the character at position [x, y]
* `setCell(x, y, value)` - sets the character at position
* `isInMazeBounds(x, y)` - checks if the position is within bounds
* `isWall(x, y)` - checks if there is a wall at the position
* `getSize()` - returns maze dimensions
* `getExitCoordinates()` / `setExitCoordinates()` - exit management

**Symbols in the Maze:**

* `#` - wall
* `.` - passage (walkable cell)
* `E` - exit
* `@` - player (drawn over the map)

#### 3.1.3 Generator Class

**Responsibility:** Generation of random mazes

**Algorithm:** Recursive backtracking (DFS-based)

**Main Methods:**

* `generate(maze, startX, startY)` - starts generation
* `carvePassages(maze, x, y)` - recursive method:

**Algorithm Principle:**

```
1. Mark current cell as passage ('.')
2. Create a list of 4 directions (up, down, left, right)
3. Shuffle directions randomly
4. For each direction:
   a) Calculate neighbor cell (2 cells away)
   b) If neighbor is in maze and is a wall:
      - Remove wall between current cell and neighbor
      - Recursively continue from neighbor

```

**Properties of Generated Maze:**

* Perfect maze (no loops)
* Exactly one path between any two points
* Fully connected (all cells are accessible)

#### 3.1.4 Player Class

**Responsibility:** Representation and movement of the player

**Data Structures:**

```cpp
class Player {
private:
    std::pair<int, int> currentPosition; // Current position

```

**Main Methods:**

* `go(direction, maze)` - player movement:
```cpp
W/w → up      (y - 1)
S/s → down    (y + 1)
A/a → left    (x - 1)
D/d → right   (x + 1)

```


* Checks movement validity (bounds and walls)
* Movement is executed only if the target cell is not a wall


* `getX()`, `getY()` - position getters
* `setCurrentPosition(x, y)` - sets position

#### 3.1.5 Renderer Class

**Responsibility:** Rendering the game to the console

**Main Methods:**

* `draw(maze, player)`:
* Clears the screen using `clearScreen()`
* Iterates through the entire maze
* Displays `@` at the player's position, otherwise the character from the maze
* Prints the result to the console


* `showTutorial()`:
* Clears the screen
* Displays help
* Waits for Enter


* `clearScreen()` (inline in header):
```cpp
// ANSI escape sequence for clearing the screen
std::cout << " [2J [H";

```



### 3.2 Data Flow and Control

#### 3.2.1 Game Initialization

```
1. main() → creates Game instance
2. Game::initialize():
   ├─→ helloFunction() - displays menu
   │   ├─→ [1] SMALL:  31x15
   │   ├─→ [2] MEDIUM: 51x21
   │   ├─→ [3] LARGE:  101x21
   │   └─→ [4] CUSTOM: user size
   │
   ├─→ customChoice() (if [4])
   │   └─→ dimension validation (11-99, odd numbers)
   │
   ├─→ Maze(width, height) - create maze
   ├─→ generator.generate(maze, 1, 1) - generate
   ├─→ maze.setExitCoordinates() - place exit
   └─→ player = Player(1, 1) - create player at start

```

#### 3.2.2 Game Loop

```
Game::run() {
    while (isRunning) {
        │
        ├─→ render()
        │   └─→ renderer.draw(maze, player)
        │       └─→ Display maze with player
        │
        ├─→ handleInput()
        │   ├─→ Read character from input
        │   ├─→ [Q] → isRunning = false (quit)
        │   ├─→ [H] → renderer.showTutorial()
        │   └─→ [W/A/S/D] → player.go(direction, maze)
        │
        └─→ update()
            └─→ If player == exit:
                ├─→ Display "Congratulations!"
                └─→ isRunning = false
    }
}

```

### 3.3 Input Validation

#### 3.3.1 Maze Size Validation (customChoice)

**Checks:**

* Width and height must be numbers
* Minimum dimension: 11x11
* Maximum dimension: 99x99
* Prevention of excessively large squares (≥ 60x60)
* Automatic conversion to odd numbers (due to generation algorithm)

**Example:**

```
Input: 20x20
Output: 21x21 (rounded up to odd)

```

#### 3.3.2 Player Movement Validation

**Checks in Player::go():**

```cpp
1. Calculate new position based on direction
2. If new position:
   - IS within maze bounds
   - IS NOT a wall
   → Execute movement
   Else → Ignore input

```

---

## 5. Game Mechanics

### 5.1 Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `W` or `w` | Move up |
| `S` or `s` | Move down |
| `A` or `a` | Move left |
| `D` or `d` | Move right |
| `H` or `h` | Show help |
| `Q` or `q` | Quit game |

### 5.2 Maze Sizes

#### Preset Sizes:

* **SMALL (31x15):** Suitable for a quick game
* **MEDIUM (51x21):** Medium difficulty
* **LARGE (101x21):** Long maze with a greater challenge

#### Custom Size:

* Minimum dimension: 11x11
* Maximum dimension: 99x99
* Dimensions are automatically adjusted to odd numbers
* Large square mazes (≥ 60x60) are not allowed due to playability

### 5.3 Win Condition

The player wins when their position matches the exit position:

```cpp
if (player.getX() == exitX && player.getY() == exitY) {
    std::cout << "Congratulations! You won\n";
    // End game
}

```

## 6. Algorithms and Data Structures

### 6.1 Recursive Backtracking for Maze Generation

**Time Complexity:** O(w × h), where w is width and h is height of the maze

**Space Complexity:** O(w × h) for storing the maze + O(w × h) for the recursion stack (worst case)

**Pseudocode:**

```
function carvePassages(maze, x, y):
    maze[x][y] = '.'  // Mark as passage

    directions = [(0,-2), (0,2), (-2,0), (2,0)]
    shuffle(directions)  // Random order

    for each (dx, dy) in directions:
        nx = x + dx
        ny = y + dy

        if isInBounds(nx, ny) and maze[nx][ny] == '#':
            wallX = (x + nx) / 2
            wallY = (y + ny) / 2
            maze[wallX][wallY] = '.'  // Remove wall
            carvePassages(maze, nx, ny)  // Recursion

```

**Why it works:**

* Starts from one point and gradually "carves" passages
* Visiting neighbors in random order ensures randomness
* Checking "already visited" (`maze[nx][ny] == '#'`) prevents cycles
* Result: connected maze without cycles

### 6.2 Maze Storage

**2D vector:**

```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<char>> maze;

```

**Cell Access:**

```cpp
char cell = maze[y][x];  // Note: [row][column]

```

**Advantages:**

* Dynamic size
* Easy O(1) access
* Intuitive indexing
