# Detailed assignment

Create a file called calculator.py and implement the following functions/operations (the name of the function and the number of parameters it requires are given in brackets):

    Addition (addition 2)
    Subtraction (subtraction 2)
    Multiplication (multiplication 2)
    Division (division 2)
    Modulo calculation (modulo 2, in our case, only variants where x >= y and y > 0 can be used)
    Calculation of the square of a number (secondPower 1)
    Calculation of the nth power of a number (power 2, order: power, exponent; in our case, only positive exponents can be used (zero is positive)) - return type float.
    Calculation of the square root of a number (secondRadix 1, the square root can only be calculated from a positive integer satisfying: x > 0)
    Magic calculation (magic 4) - the operation will be explained
    Main control function (control 5) - the function will be explained

Each of the above functions returns a calculation in the output. If the calculation cannot be performed, the function raises an exception ValueError('This operation is not supported for given input parameters').
