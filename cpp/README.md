## PCC - Programming in C/C++
The course B6B36PCC taught the C++ programming language. The material was intended for intermediate programmers; prior knowledge of C or C++ was not required. The aim was not only to familiarize students with the basics of C++ and its practical use, but also to help them understand some of the basic concepts of working with memory.
