# Task 10 - Dijkstra

Your tenth task is to implement Dijkstra's algorithm and use it to find the shortest paths in a graph (Shortest Path Problem). The graph will be given to you using structures (vertices and edges), where the edges are positively weighted and oriented. The graph may contain cycles.
