## Task 01 – Copies and References

Incomplete code implementing two overloads of the `pluralize` function is provided:

```cpp
std::string pluralize(std::string const& str);
std::vector<std::string> pluralize(std::vector<std::string> const& str);
```
The function is intended to convert a word (or a vector of words) into the plural form. The provided implementation contains errors; the code is to be modified to ensure all tests pass.
