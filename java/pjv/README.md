## PJV - Programming in Java
### Synopsis

The course builds on the basics of algorithms and programming from the first semester and introduces students to the Java environment. The course also focus on the object concept of the Java language. The topics of the course includes exceptions, event handling, and building a graphical interface. Basic library methods, working with files and using generic types will be introduced. An important topic is models of multithreaded applications and their implementation.
Practical exercises of practical skills and knowledge of Java is tested in the form of solving partial tasks and semester work, which will be submitted continuously through the source code version control system. The semester work scoring consists of points for the correctness and efficiency of the code, as well as points that take into account the quality of the source codes, their readability and reusability.

### Goals of study
The aim of the course is to develop students' programming skills and expand their knowledge of programming languages by the basics and specifics of the Java programming language. The course is based on an object-oriented approach, students deepen their knowledge of programming methods and get acquainted with the Java programming interface for multithreaded programming, using data collections, exception handling, graphical user interface creation and event-driven programming.

### Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of algorithms and programming.
