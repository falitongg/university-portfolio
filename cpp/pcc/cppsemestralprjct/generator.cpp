/**
 * @brief Recursively carves passages from a given cell.
 *
 * The algorithm:
 *  - marks the current cell as a passage ('.'),
 *  - creates a list of four possible directions (up, down, left, right),
 *  - shuffles the directions randomly,
 *  - for each direction computes the neighbour two cells away,
 *  - if the neighbour is inside the maze and still a wall ('#'),
 *    removes the wall between current cell and the neighbour and
 *    continues recursively from the neighbour.
 *
 * This produces a connected maze with no cycles (perfect maze).
 *
 * @param maze Reference to the maze being modified.
 * @param x    Current cell x‑coordinate.
 * @param y    Current cell y‑coordinate.
