# Detailed assignment

Create a file called linewriter.py and write a function called writeTextToFile with one input parameter. The function will concatenate (i.e., join) the contents of the STATICKY_TEXT variable (listed below) with the received argument (i.e., the current value of the input parameter). The concatenation order will be as follows: first the static text, then the argument. Write the resulting string to a file of any name, and return the name of this file as the function's return value.

The STATICKY_TEXT variable contains: "This is my static text which must be added to file. It is very long text and I do not know what they want to do with this terrible text. "
